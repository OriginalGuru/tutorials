    "## What is Git?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Git** is a tool that helps you keep track of changes you make to your files. It allows you to save different versions of your work, so you can go back and see what changes you've made or revert to an earlier version if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is GitHub?\n",
    "\n",
    "**GitHub** is a website where you can store your projects online and share them with others. You can use **GitHub** to collaborate with others on projects, track issues, and host your project's documentation and website.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Git Credential Manager?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Git Credential Manager** helps you securely save your username and password when you are working with online repositories (like GitHub). This way, you don't have to enter your credentials every time you perform an action like saving your changes or downloading a project."
