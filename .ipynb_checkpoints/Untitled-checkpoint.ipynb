    "# Cloning Your First Repository from GitHub Classroom\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will learn how to clone a repository from a GitHub Classroom link shared with you on Canvas. Cloning a repository allows you to create a local copy of the project on your computer, where you can make changes, track progress, and eventually push your work back to GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you start, make sure you have completed the following:\n",
    "- **GitHub Account**: You should have a GitHub account and be logged in.\n",
    "- **Git Installed**: You should have Git installed on your machine.\n",
    "- **Credential Manager Configured**: Ensure that you've set up a credential manager to securely save your GitHub credentials.\n",
    "- **Python Virtual Environment**: You have installed Miniforge3 and set up a Python virtual environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Obtain the GitHub Classroom Link\n",
    "\n",
    "Your instructor will share a GitHub Classroom link on Canvas. This link is unique to your assignment and will allow you to create your own repository for the task/assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Navigate to Canvas and locate the assignment post that contains the GitHub Classroom link.\n",
    "- Click on the link and copy your unique repository link. It will look something like\n",
    "\n",
    "  `https://github.com/Phys3510-Fall2024/test-assignment-[your-user-name]`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2: Clone the Repository\n",
    "\n",
    "Open a Terminal or Git BASH.\n",
    "1. **Create a directory for your repos**:\n",
    "    - In the Terminal, create a new directory for this class, using the following commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "      `mkdir repos`\n",
    "      \n",
    "      `cd repos`\n",
    "\n",
    "      `mkdir phys3510`\n",
    "\n",
    "      `cd phys3510`\n",
    "\n",
    "      This series of commands makes a directory `repos`, changes the directory to `repos`, makes a new directory in `repos` called `phys3510`, and changed the active directory to `phys3510`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Clone the Repository**:\n",
    "    - In the terminal, type the following command to clone the repository:\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "    `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "    - Replace `https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git` with the URL you copied from GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Input GitHub Credentials**:\n",
    "    - If this is your first time cloning a repository, you may be prompted to enter your GitHub username and password. This will activate the credential manager, which will store your credentials securely for future use.\n",
    "    - After entering your credentials, the cloning process will begin. Git will download the entire repository to your local machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 3: Navigating Your Cloned Repository\n",
    "\n",
    "After the cloning process is complete:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Change into the Repository Directory**:\n",
    "    - Use the `ls` to show the directory you cloned. Then use the `cd` command to navigate into the newly cloned repository:\n",
    "\n",
    "    `ls -l`\n",
    "\n",
    "    `cd your-repository`\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Replace `your-repository` with the actual name of the cloned directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Check the Status**:\n",
    "    - Run the following command to check the status of your repository:\n",
    "\n",
    "    `git status`\n",
    "\n",
    "    - This command will show you if there are any changes made to the files in the repository and whether they are staged for a commit.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 4: Start Working on Your Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "With your repository cloned, you're now ready to start working on your assignment. For this assignment, we are going to rename the existing file `temp.txt` and edit its contents with `vim`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, let's rename/move the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "    `mv temp.txt hello.txt`\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. This command moves `temp.txt` to a new file `hello.txt`. Now let's edit the contents of `hello.txt`.\n",
    "    \n",
    "   `vim hello.txt`\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Now push **\"i\"** on your keyboard to enter `INSERT` mode. You can now delete the contents of the file, then write **\"hello\"** or any other message.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. To exit `INSERT` mode, push the `ESC` button.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. To save the file push **\":\"** then **\"wq\"** and `ENTER/RETURN`. This enters the `Command-Line` mode within `vim` and writes (w) and quits (q).\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to save your changes frequently and use Git commands like `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` to track and submit your work.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 5: Submit Your Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "To submit your assignment, you can use the standard `git` commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Check the Status:**\n",
    " \n",
    "    `git status`\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Explanation:* This command shows the current state of your project. It tells you which changes have been staged, which files are being tracked, and which are not. It's like a quick overview of what's going on with your project.\n",
    " \n",
    "* **Add changes:**\n",
    " \n",
    "    `git add .`\n",
    " \n",
    "    *Explanation:* This command stages all changes you've made for the next commit. Staging is like preparing your changes to be saved.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Commit changes:**\n",
    " \n",
    "    `git commit -m \"Your commit message\"`\n",
    " \n",
    "    *Explanation:* This command saves your staged changes with a message describing what you did. Committing is like making a permanent record of your changes. The message helps you and others understand what was changed and why.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Push Changes:**\n",
    " \n",
    "    `git push`\n",
    " \n",
    "    *Explanation:* This command uploads your committed changes to GitHub. It's like sending your saved work to the cloud so others can see and collaborate with you.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "In this guide, you've learned how to:\n",
    "1. Clone a GitHub repository using a link from GitHub Classroom.\n",
